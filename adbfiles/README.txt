adbLink is a companion program for any device running Android Kodi. adbLink allows you to install (sideload) apps to your device without the bother of installing the Android SDK.
Additionally, it allows you copy files to and from your device, backup and restore Kodi's data, and more.

To run adbLink you need to first set up your Android device and discover your
IP address and change some settings.
