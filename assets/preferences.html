<b><u>The Device Setup Dialog</b></u>
<p>

<b><u>Description</b></u><br>
Enter a descriptive title for your device.
<p>
<b><u>Address</b></u><br>
Enter the device IP address. A device name is also allowable
if you have set it up with your router.
<p>

<b><u>Package name</b></u>, default: org.xbmc.kodi. <br>
Select the package name by choosing your media center software from the Media Center presets, or enter package name directly.
<p>
If you are running Kodi leave this setting unchanged.
<p>

<b><u>File Path</b></u>, default: files/.kodi <br>
Change the file path by choosing a selection from the Media Center presets or enter your own.
<p>
The period "." that you see at the beginning of "files" is very important. Don't leave it off!
<p>
The File Path is not set up on your Fire Device until Kodi has completed its initial run. adbLink uses the File Path in conjunction with the Package Name to locate the Media Center on your device. If either are entered incorrectly, none of the "Kodi" functions will work.
<p>
<b><u>Media Center presets</b></u><br>
4 presets are provided for Package name and filepath:<br>
Kodi<br>
SPMC<br>
TVMC<br>
Other (your package) <br>
Select a preset with the Media Center radio buttons. The default is Kodi.

<p>
<b><u>Pull Folder</b></u>, default: User's home directory.<br>
Choose the folder where pulled Kodi files and screenshot pngs are placed.
<p>
<b><u>AFTV updates</b></u> Toggle AFTV updates on/off. This disables/enables com.amazon.dcp. Default is updates on. Changing this option requires root.
<p>
<b><u>SSH server at boot</b></u> When checked this option has the SSH server start at boot. This option requires root.
<p>
The <b>Check for updates at startup</b> checkbox causes adbLink to check jocala.com for updates at startup. This is on by default.
<p>
The <b>Check for updates</b> button contacts jocala.com for an immediate update check. If an update is available adbLink offers to connect for download.
