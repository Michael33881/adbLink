The <b>"Screen shot"</b> button takes a snapshot of the device's current screen, gives it a date/time based name, and saves it to the pulled files folder (default: home directory).<p> Unfortunately, High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) prevents you from taking screenshots of most commercia video streams. Luckily, Kodi is not affected by HDCP.<p>
<p>
Unfortunately, some users are reporting screenshot failures with OS5, even when attempted via a direct adb command, i.e.
<p>
adb shell screencap -p  /sdcard/screenshot.png
<p>
The reason for these failures is unknown, and they can't be corrected by adbLink since they occur at the operating system level. Amazon is aware of the issue, but no fix seems to be forthcoming.

If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbLink produces a log file, adbfire.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
