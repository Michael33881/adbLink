The <b>"Backup"</b> button backs up the contents of the .kodi folder on the device. Please note that Kodi <u>MUST</u> have been run for the first time before using this function. Empty directories are not backed up.
If you are running something other than <a href=kodi.html>Kodi</a> you will need to change the package name amd File Path
in the <a href=preferences.html>Device Setup</a> dialog to whatever package name and File Path your software uses.
<p>

Choose your Kodi partition:
/sdcard/ is the default partition for Kodi data. If you have <a href="mvdata.html">moved data</a>, adbLink displays all system-approved external partitions, select the external partition where the data resides. 
<p>


If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbLink produces a log file, adbfire.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
