<u><b>"USB Drives" </b> </u><br>
The Mount/Unmount buttons mount/unmount connected USB drives or sticks.
<p>
This release of adbLink has a script, /system/xbin/mntdrives2.sh, that you
can edit to assign UUIDs or labels  to specific mount points (e.g. /storage/usb/movies),
if you're interested, read the script and post any questions you may have.

If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbLink produces a log file, adbfire.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
